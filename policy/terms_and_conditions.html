                            and other understandings relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, and that all
                            waivers and modifications must be in a writing signed by both parties, except as otherwise
                            provided herein.
                            No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of this
                            Agreement and Customer does not have any authority of any kind to bind Company in any
                            respect whatsoever.
                            In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under this Agreement, the prevailing party
                            will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys’ fees.
                            All notices under this Agreement will be in writing and will be deemed to have been duly
                            given when received, if personally delivered; when receipt is electronically confirmed, if
                            transmitted by facsimile or e-mail; the day after it is sent, if sent for next day delivery
                            by recognized overnight delivery service; and upon receipt, if sent by certified or

                            This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of Israel without regard to its
                            conflict of laws provisions. The courts of law of the State of Israel shall have exclusive
                            jurisdiction over any dispute arising under and by virtue of this agreement.
                            The Company has the right to revise and amend this Agreement from time to time to reflect
                            changes in market conditions affecting the Company’s business, changes in technology and
                            changes in the Systems capabilities. The Company will endeavour to provide the Customer with
                            prior written notice of any proposed changes to this Agreement sufficient time ahead, and
                            the Customer can choose to terminate the Agreement before the new terms come into effect.
                            Neither Party shall be responsible for delays or failures in performance resulting from
                            event of Force Majeure. “Force Majeure” means: an event or series of events not under the
                            reasonable control of the Party affected, which affects that Party’s ability to perform any
                            of its duties according to the Agreement, including failures affecting the ability to use
                            the System and Services due to delay in communications and/or failure of the internet, power
                            failures, computer crashes or any other technical failure, whether originated at the
                            telephone companies, the various telecommunication lines, ISP computers, and including any
                            event or series of events commonly and reasonably considered as Force Majeure, for example:
                            industrial disputes affecting any of the Parties, riots, terrorist attacks, war, changes of
                            law or regulations, disasters (natural or caused by man) such as fire, floods, explosions
                            etc. provided that if such Force Majeure event continues for a period of 14 days or more,
                            Customer shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with immediate effect. In case the
                            Client terminates on the occurrence of a Force Majeure event, the Client shall in any case
                            be liable to make payment for all Services rendered to it.
