                    Google Analytics is a web analytics service offered by Google that tracks and reports website

                    personalize the ads of its own advertising network. You can opt-out of having made your activity on
                    the Web Sites available to Google Analytics by installing the Google Analytics opt-out browser
                    add-on. The add-on prevents the Google Analytics JavaScript (ga.js, analytics.js, and dc.js) from
                    sharing information with Google Analytics about visits activity. For more information on the privacy
